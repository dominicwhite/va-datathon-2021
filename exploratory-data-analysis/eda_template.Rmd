```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
datathon_df <- readRDS("../data/datathon.rds")
```

## Example ggplot graph

```{r}
datathon_df %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(census_B08201_001, census_B08201_002)) +
  labs(x = "Total households in county", y = "Households with no vehicles")
```

## Example choropleth map

```{r}
datathon_df %>%
  mutate(
    pct_no_vehicle = 100 * census_B08201_002 / census_B08201_001
  ) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = pct_no_vehicle)) +
  labs(title = "% of households with no vehicle")
```
